Creeping on my stuff? This is a pet project that will be meant as a [technology demonstration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_demonstration) about how the browser might one day implement DOM diffing and (even less likely) JSX. Or just generally how the React-model might one day evolve into.

This is not currently meant as usable framework you should build your apps with. That said, early benchmarks actually blew away my expectations and depending on reception this may grow into something usable.
